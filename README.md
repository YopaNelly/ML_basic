## Introduction

In this module, you will gain a foundational understanding of regression, a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The module is designed to be accessible to learners with varying levels of expertise in regression analysis.

## Regression Methods

The module covers the following regression methods:

- **Linear Regression**: Modeling linear relationships between variables.
- **Non-linear Regression**: Exploring non-linear patterns and relationships.
- **Simple Regression**: Analyzing relationships between a single independent variable and a dependent variable.
- **Multiple Regression**: Extending analysis to multiple independent variables and their impact on the dependent variable.

## Lab Exercises

Hands-on learning is crucial for mastering regression techniques. The lab exercises included in this module guide you through applying the discussed regression methods to real-world datasets. These practical sessions enhance your understanding and skills in regression analysis.

## Evaluation and Accuracy

Understanding how to evaluate the performance of your regression model is essential. This module covers methods for assessing the accuracy of your models, ensuring that you can make informed decisions based on the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Regression Module, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
